                The NEB program offers two distinct streams: Science and
                Management. Each stream provides students with subject options
                tailored to their academic interests and career aspirations.

                The teachers-to-student ratio at GEMS is structured to give
                maximum attention to the students. Most classes will have 26 to
                28 students.Â  Some of our A-level classes will have as few as 10
                students for some subjects.
