            We provide students with a stimulating environment for enriched
            learning. At the High School, students not only gain academic
            knowledge and skills but also develop their confidence through
            continuous assessments of their performance. A maximum of 25
            students are housed in a class to enable the faculty to provide
            students with individual attention and care. <br /> <br /> Students
            are encouraged to inquire and participate in discussions, and they
            are assessed regularly through unit tests and terminal examinations.
            Generally, three unit tests and three terminal examinations are
            conducted in a year. In addition, project work, presentations,
            assignments, etc. are assigned to students regularly to make them
            responsible, reflective, innovative, and engaged. <br /> <br />{" "}
            Students are required to obtain a minimum of 40 percent marks in all
            the subjects in the overall internal assessments to qualify for
            appearing in the board examinations. <br /> <br /> Students are also
            frequently taken on field visits to gain hands-on experience in
            different subjects. From time to time, professionals from different
            fields such as medicine, engineering, applied science, management,
            etc. are invited to interact with the students and talk about their
            professions to enable them to decide on their future careers.
